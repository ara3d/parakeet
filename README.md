# Parakeet

Parakeet is a fast and simple parsing library written in C#. 
Parakeet evolved from the [Jigsaw parser](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/272494/Implementing-Programming-Languages-using-Csharp) and applies lessons learned when writing 
the [Myna parsing library in TypeScript](https://cdiggins.github.io/myna-parser/). 
Parakeet is designed to be as fast as possible while retaining a clean and elegant grammar description.
